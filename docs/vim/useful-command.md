## Some of the useful Vim commands

### Directory tree
- Based on [Nerd Tree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
- `ctrl+e' open/hide
- `j` and `k` move down/up
- `enter` open file

### Run the Same Command Again
- !!
- Example: you ran apt-get install XXX but it said you don't have the permission. Instead of `up arrow` + `ctrl + a` + 'type sudo', you can just go `sudo !!`

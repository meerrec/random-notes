 This provides the web browser (or other user agent) with information about the type of markup language in which the page is written, which may or may not affect the way the browser renders the content.

The head element contains metadata—information that describes the document itself, or associates it with related resources, such as scripts and style sheets.

Everything that you can see in the browser window (or viewport) is contained inside this element, including paragraphs, lists, links, images, tables, and more.

The basic structure of an HTML document includes tags, which surround content and apply meaning to it.

Tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information. Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks. They look something like <tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag>. We will come across tags with attributes later.

Tags tend not to do much more than mark the beginning and end of an element. Elements are the bits that make up web pages. You would say, for example, that everything that is in between (and includes) the <body> and </body> tags is the body element. As another example, whereas “<title>” and “</title>” are tags, “<title>Rumple Stiltskin</title>” is a title element.

## Why I choose Ghost instead of Wordpress and Jekyll

### Some note about Ghost
I’m pretty sure you need no introduction to WordPress. In light of that, for now, let’s focus on what Ghost actually is. Initially funded by an extremely successful Kickstarter Campaign by John O’Nolan — which raised almost $200,000 — Ghost is positioned as a simple publishing platform. It is, as the big introduction text on the official Ghost website clearly says: “Just a blogging platform“.

You can tell from the main admin screen that Ghost really is meant for blogging, and blogging only. No custom post types, no plugins, no permalink tweaking, and complex settings to fiddle with. You get a list of your posts with a preview on the right and the option to add or edit posts.

### Personal taste on the stack, language, and technologies.
- Ghost (`node.js` and `handlebars`)
- Wordpress (`php`)
- Jekyll (`ruby and rails`)

Nearly every project was my company is written in `node`, `express`, and `handlebars` before we changed our development stack to `React` and `Sails.js` recently. So from my experience, I's like to choose something that I can control everything. When I am trying to add some new features with a wordpress site, it is really painful to find the right plug-in (almost every good plug-in is not free!) and working on the configuration after finding them. It is really hard to me to change something which is not mentioned in the plug-in setting  or documentations. However, for Ghost, it is really convinient for me to write some customized stuff by myself and I can also go though the code I need in a fluent way.

### Host
There are tons of wordpress host companies in the market these days and the price range is from $10 to an unknown number based on the performance, the disk and the network trafiic of the host. I'm not a guy for some so called auto generating tools for wordpress. I prefer set all stuff up within a pure Lunix machine. So AWS from Amazon is one of the best place for me to get started.

### The Most Popular Topics in Current Front End Development

* ES6

    ECMAScript 6 (ES6, often referred to as “Harmony”) is the upcoming sixth major release of the ECMAScript language specification. ECMAScript is the “proper” name for the language commonly referred to as JavaScript.

    Although ES6 has not been fully supported yet in most of the popular browsers, as well as in node.js enviroment, there is no doubt that ES6 will definitely replace what we are using right now in the near future. Besides, tons of popular Javascript libraries and frameworks has been rewritten to ES6 version with documentatins and tutorials. So it's the time to get started with ES6 along with some of its wonderful features.

    The best way to make your ES6 work is using [babel](https://babeljs.io/), which is a Javascript complier for ES6. Please search *how to set babel* online for more infomarion.

* React

    [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) is a UI library developed at Facebook to facilitate the creation of interactive, stateful & reusable UI components. It is used at Facebook in production, and Instagram.com is written entirely in React.

    One of it’s unique selling points is that not only does it perform on the client side, but it can also be rendered server side, and they can work together inter-operably.

    It also uses a concept called the Virtual DOM that selectively renders subtrees of nodes based upon state changes. It does the least amount of DOM manipulation possible in order to keep your components up to date.

* Flux

    Flux is an architecture for creating data layers in JavaScript applications. It was designed at Facebook along with the React view library. It places a focus on creating explicit and understandable update paths for your application's data, which makes tracing changes during development simpler and makes bugs easier to track down and fix.

    Basically there are a lot of implementations for flux architecture, and [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) is the most widely used the popular one.

* Node.js

    [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

    For most of the people, the benefit of node.js is only that we are write both front end and backend code in the same language. However, it has the certain reason that node.js is one of the must-have skill or requirement for a front end engineer. You won't probably need to care about any of the server part of a web application, but you do have to use at least one of [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) in your development, which may be just one part of the benefit you can get from node.js to improve or speed your development process. So you should get familiar with it.

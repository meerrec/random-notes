### Tools you need to have
You will need the following things to follow along the contents:

* A modern browser (The lateset version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) is highly recommanded)
* Editor/IDE
    Although you can use some online editor instead, a native editor/IDE ([Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), [Atom](https://atom.io/), Webstorm, Vim, Emacs) is highly recommanded.

### Some personal experiences

* There is no _best_ book or tutorial exsited. The more you write, the faster you learn.
* Google, Stackoverflow, and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) docs are your best resources.
* Do not try to memorize all stuff at the begining, that's a waste of time and not efficiate.
* Web development has changed a lot during the recent 10 years, and Javascript is not a toy any more.
* If you want to find a job in a great company related to web development, you have to be a software engineer first, then a web specialist.

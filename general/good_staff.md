### Something seems good for play with or use

- [node-notifier](https://github.com/mikaelbr/node-notifier)
    - A Node.js module for sending notifications on native Mac, Windows and Linux (or Growl as fallback)

- [z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
    - Tracks your most used directories, based on 'frecency'.
    - After  a  short  learning  phase, z will take you to the most 'frecent' directory that matches ALL of the regexes given on the command line, in order.
    - For example, z foo bar would match /foo/bar but not /bar/foo.
